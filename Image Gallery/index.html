        <h1>First American Flag</h1>
        <img src="Creation of American Flag.png" alt="Image 2">
        <p>The creation of the first American flag is often attributed to Betsy Ross, a seamstress from Philadelphia. According to popular legend, in 1776, George Washington, Robert Morris, and George Ross (Betsy Ross's late husband's uncle) approached Betsy Ross to create a flag for the newly formed United States. They presented her with a rough design featuring thirteen alternating red and white stripes representing the thirteen colonies, along with thirteen stars in a circle to symbolize unity.

            Betsy Ross suggested a change from the six-pointed stars in the original design to five-pointed stars, which she found easier to cut. She then demonstrated how to cut a five-pointed star with a single snip of the scissors, leading to the design's adoption.
            
            However, it's important to note that the historical accuracy of this account is debated, as there is limited concrete evidence directly linking Betsy Ross to the creation of the first American flag. The story gained popularity in the 19th century, but some historians argue that there is insufficient evidence to confirm Betsy Ross's involvement. Nonetheless, her name remains closely associated with the creation of the American flag, and her house in Philadelphia has become a popular tourist attraction.</p>
